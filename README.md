# Forms-Creator
###This project is still under development 


A simple forms creator


The nodejs version is included in the package.json file


Mongodb is required to start the project
```npm start``` in the root will start the Back-End on the port ***5000*** and the Front-End on the port ***3000***

To change the URL which the Fron't end sends requests to, change the proxy in the client/package.json to the desired URL
